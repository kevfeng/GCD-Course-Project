# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
### Repo Contents
1. run_analysis.R - This file takes a set of raw data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (located at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) and applies several transforms to the dataset to create a tidy dataset for further analysis. Specifically, the "Test" and "Train" portions of the data are merged together, descriptive activity names are added to the dataset, and the mean and standard deviation variables are averaged by subject and by activity.

2. Course Project Codebook - This document describes the variables that are being measured in further detail.

<i> Note: Additional description for the variable names is located in the Code Book (step 4)
